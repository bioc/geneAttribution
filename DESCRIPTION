Title: Identification of candidate genes associated with genetic
        variation

Description: Identification of the most likely gene or genes through
        which variation at a given genomic locus in the human genome
        acts. The most basic functionality assumes that the closer gene
        is to the input locus, the more likely the gene is to be
        causative. Additionally, any empirical data that links genomic
        regions to genes (e.g. eQTL or genome conformation data) can be
        used if it is supplied in the UCSC .BED file format.
